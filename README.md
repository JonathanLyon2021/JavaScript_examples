# JavaScript_examples

These are some examples in JavaScript Language that I have been practicing. I have more examples updating soon at the time of creating this repository.
I am working on implementing javascript functionality inside solidity using libraries that have been reccomended to me through my network of classmates at Kingsland 
University online(code bootcamp). Inparticularly, wagmi-dev/wagmi library here on GitHub. Some of these exercises are from different places online that help users practice code using their problems that are offered. Thanks for viewing my repository!
