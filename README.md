# JavaScript_examples

These are some examples in JavaScript Language that I have been practicing lately. I have more examples updating soon at the time of creating this repository.
I am working on implementing javascript functionality inside solidity using libraries that have been reccomended to me through my network of classmates at Kingsland University. Particularly wagmi-dev/wagmi here on GitHub. Thanks for viewing my repository!
