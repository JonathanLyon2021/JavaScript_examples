# JavaScript_examples

These are some examples of JavaScript that I have been practicing lately. 
I am working on implementing javascript functionality inside solidity using libraries that have been 
reccomended to me through my network of classmates at Kingsland University.
Particularly wagmi-dev/wagmi here on GitHub. Thanks for viewing my repository!
